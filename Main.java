//	    Variables in Java:-
        /*
        A variable is like a container to store values.
        Example:-
            We keep candies in a box, in this case, candies are a value and box is a container.
        Similarly in Java we have variables to store variables.

        We define variable with the syntax:-
        var name_of_variable = value;

        Example:-
         */
        int a = 21; // Here a is an int or integer type variable with value 21.
        String b = "Hello World"; // Here b is a string type variable with value "Hello World".
        /*
        Variable rules:-
            1. Variable's name cannot begin with special characters and numbers except for '_'.
            2. There cannot be 2 variables with the same name.
            3. Variable name should not be a java keyword, eg - class, byte etc.
            4. The variable type should be suitable, or if you are not sure of the variable type, use the keyword var.
            Example:-
         */
        var Variable = "Use var if you are not sure.";
        var num = 21;

        // Thank You !!!
